It seems like your CardNews components are re-rendering more often than necessary when you scroll down the page. This could be due to several factors:

    1 - State Changes Triggering Re-renders: Every time you fetch more news and update your state (newsData, pageNumber, etc.), it causes the whole NewsPage component to re-render. Since CardNews is a child of this component, it also gets re-rendered.

    2 - Props Changes: If the props passed to CardNews are changing on each render of NewsPage, this will cause CardNews to re-render. Since you're using memo in CardNews, it should only re-render if its props change. Make sure that the props (especially the news object) aren't being recreated on every render of NewsPage.

    3 - Inefficient Scroll Handling: Your scroll handling logic might be triggering state updates too often, leading to excessive re-renders. Make sure your scroll event handler is optimized to not trigger state changes more often than necessary.

To address these issues, consider the following:

    - Optimize State Updates: Be cautious about how state changes are handled. Try to minimize the number of state updates and ensure they are only done when absolutely necessary.

    - Memoization of Props: Ensure that objects passed as props to CardNews are memoized. If these objects are being created anew on each render, it will cause unnecessary re-renders.

    - Throttle Scroll Events: Consider using a throttle function to limit how often your scroll event handler is called. This can prevent unnecessary state updates and re-renders.

    - Check for Unnecessary Updates: Use React's developer tools to check why the components are re-rendering. Look at the why did render feature to understand the cause of the re-renders.

By carefully managing state updates and props, and optimizing the scroll event handler, you should be able to reduce the number of unnecessary re-renders of CardNews.




The problem in your code seems to be related to the rendering and state management process, particularly around the scroll event handling and data fetching logic. Here are a few suggestions to improve it:

    Rendering of Skeletons and Articles: Ensure that the rendering logic for skeletons and articles doesn't cause unnecessary re-renders. Verify that renderNewsOrSkeletons only updates when necessary. The usage of loading or hasReachedBottom flags seems correct, but ensure these states change only when required.

    Scroll Event Handling Optimization: Your scroll event handler handleScroll might be triggering the setHasReachedBottom state change too frequently. A common approach is to throttle or debounce this handler to limit how often it sets state.

    State Updates in useEffect: In the useEffect hook that handles fetching more data when reaching the bottom, you're correctly setting setHasReachedBottom(false) after dispatching the fetch action. However, ensure that this state change only happens when needed to avoid unnecessary triggers.

    Use of useCallback and useEffect: Review the dependencies of these hooks. For instance, handleScroll is dependent on hasReachedBottom â€” ensure that this dependency is causing the behavior you expect.

    Efficient Data Fetching and State Management: When new data is fetched and stored in Redux, it can cause re-renders. Check how your Redux state is managed and updated. Ideally, you should append new items to your state rather than replacing it entirely unless necessary.

    Memoization of Components: For components like CardNews, ensure they are memoized correctly. If props passed to them are changing too often, it can lead to frequent re-renders.

    Development Tools for Debugging: Use React Developer Tools to inspect the components and understand why they are re-rendering. Look for the "why did render" feature or similar functionalities in your development tools.
